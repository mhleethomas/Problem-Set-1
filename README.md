# Problem Set: Statistical Analysis and Modeling with Auto, Boston Housing, Carseats, and Toyota Corolla Data Sets

This problem set explores four different datasets (Auto, Boston Housing, Carseats, and Toyota Corolla) to perform data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. Each question set delves into understanding data through statistical summaries, graphical investigation, and regression analysis. The problem set covers various data science and statistical concepts including linear regression, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and multiple linear regression analysis.

### Overview of Questions
This problem set is divided into five main questions:

1. **Auto Data Analysis**: Analyze quantitative and qualitative variables, remove missing values, investigate ranges and statistical summaries, visualize relationships, and predict gas mileage (`mpg`).
2. **Boston Housing Data Analysis**: Explore the characteristics of suburbs, investigate predictors of crime rate, and analyze relationships among variables in the Boston housing data.
3. **Carseats Data Analysis**: Develop a regression model to predict store sales based on selected predictors, interpret coefficients, and calculate confidence intervals.
4. **Toyota Corolla Data Analysis**: Examine variables predicting car prices, investigate variable relationships, and build linear regression models with multiple predictors.
5. **Boston Crime Rate Prediction**: Build regression models to predict per capita crime rate using other predictors and investigate non-linear associations.

### Data Descriptions

1. **Auto Data Set**: This dataset includes attributes like `mpg`, `cylinders`, `displacement`, and other characteristics of different car models.
2. **Boston Housing Data**: Contains attributes of different suburbs, such as `crim` (crime rate), `rm` (average rooms per dwelling), `tax` (property tax), and more.
3. **Carseats Data Set**: Data about various stores with attributes such as `Sales`, `Price`, `Advertising`, and `ShelveLoc` (shelving location quality).
4. **Toyota Corolla Data Set**: Information on Toyota Corolla sales with attributes like `Price`, `Age`, `Mileage`, `FuelType`, `Horsepower`, and others.
